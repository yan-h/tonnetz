# tonnetz
A web application for visualizing and playing triads in the Tonnetz.

All notes use a Shepard tone effect, so none of them are truly higher or lower than any other. Going around the clock in a circle is perceived as infinitely ascending/descending in pitch. This is as close as I could get to "playing" octave-agnostic pitch classes.

## instructions
'C' to clear.

Click on a note on the clock to toggle whether it is played.

Click on a triangle on the Tonnetz to play all adjacent notes (a major/minor triad).
